We have been focusing on documentation and tutorials for the last
month or so. I have been working on using [Sphinx](sphinx-doc.org) to
document the Connectal BSV libraries. In the process, I have 
implemented a BSV domain for Sphinx.

The [Connectal Reference](http://www.connectal.org/doc/current/ref/)
is still just a skeleton, because even in skeleton form it at least
gives an index of key Connectal interfaces and modules.
