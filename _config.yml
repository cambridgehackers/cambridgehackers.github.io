  Connectal supports flexible and consistent partitioning of
  accelerated applications across hardware and software
  components. The Connectal framework connects hardware and software
  via remote asynchronous method invocation by compiling interface
  declarations. It enables concurrent access to hardware accelerators
  from software. Connectal enables high-bandwidth sharing of system
  memory with hardware accelerators. Connectal provides portability
  across platforms.
